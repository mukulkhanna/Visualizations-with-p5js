# Visualizations with P5.js

Inspired by [Dan](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman), here are some of my attempts at visualizing algorithms, sequences, animations and some games using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).

### List of sketches:
1. [Interactive Nearest-Neighbour  Visualization](https://mukulkhanna.github.io/Visualizations-with-p5js/Interactive%20Nearest-Neighbour%20%20Visualization/)
